      Number using O5 output only:               0
      Number using O5 and O6:                    9
      Number used as ROM:                        0
    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of  15,616    0%

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                    20 out of  15,822    1%
  Nummber of MUXCYs used:                        0 out of  31,644    0%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:           50
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:             9 out of      50   18%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   0 out of      50    0%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:          41 out of      50   82%

    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              25 out of 126,576    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
